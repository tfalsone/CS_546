    <main>
        <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
        <p>Favorite class: Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned a lot of cool ways to program, and it is the class that pushed me to want to become a computer engineer.</p>
        <aside>Favorite memory: Going out with friends for my 21st birthday</aside>
        <h2>South River High School</h2>
        <p>Favorite class: Pre Engineering, a class that allowed me to think outside the box, work with my hands, and approach problems however I wanted to. It allowed me to be creative and experiment.</p>
        <aside>Favorite memory: Winning the state championship baseball game</aside>
